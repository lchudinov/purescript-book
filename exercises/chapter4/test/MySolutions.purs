-- (Medium) Write a function binomial which finds the coefficient of the xk
-- th term in the polynomial expansion of (1+x)n
-- . This is the same as the number of ways to choose a subset of k
--  elements from a set of n
--  elements. Use the formula n!/k!(nâˆ’k)!
-- , where !
--  is the factorial function written earlier. Hint: Use pattern matching to handle corner cases. If it takes a long time to complete or crashes with an error about the call stack, try adding more corner cases.
